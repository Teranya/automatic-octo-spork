# Motion and Kinematics in UI

A personal reference of different ways design systems define motion and kinematics for their UI. Created for my reference, and to visualize easings in the form of section scrolling.

## Design systems referenced:
- [Fluent UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/motion/timing-and-easing)
- [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/kinetics/choreography/kinetics-and-interaction/)
- [Cardbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview/#easing)
- [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/applying-easing-and-duration)




## Upcoming:
- Cover M3
- Include information on speed timings 
- Wrap up more designs systems


### Design systems to be added eventually:
- [Audi](https://www.audi.com/ci/en/intro/basics/animation.html)
- [FutureLearn](https://storybook.futurelearn.com/?path=/story/welcome--page)
- [Acorn](https://acorn.firefox.com/latest/acorn.html)
