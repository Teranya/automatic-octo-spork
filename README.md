# Motion and Kinematics in UI

A reference of different ways design systems define motion and kinematics for their UI. Created for my reference, and to visualize easings in the form of section scrolling.

## Design systems referenced:
- [Fluent UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/motion/timing-and-easing)
- [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/kinetics/choreography/kinetics-and-interaction/)
- [Cardbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview/#easing)
- [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html)
